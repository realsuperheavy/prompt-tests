In contrast, when he said, “I’m having a layover in France”, he meant that he was merely passing through from one place to another.\n\nAnother example of code switching occurs when Tom says, “I’m so hungry I could eat a bear,” and then he explains that it’s an expression he heard growing up and that he’s no longer hungry. In other words, even though he’s no longer hungry, he still retains the knowledge of the expression.\n\nAlso, in the following example, Tom says, “I’m going to visit the Parthenon in Greece,” but then corrects himself, changing it to “I’m going to visit the Parthenon in Athens.”\n\nFinally, in the following example, Tom says, “I’m a humble former mayor,” meaning that he’s both humble and a former mayor, but then he corrects himself, saying that he’s merely the former mayor.\n\nNow that we’ve covered the kind of code switching that uses synonyms, let’s look at the kind that uses non-synonyms.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4: NON-SYNONYM SWITCHING\n\n\n\n“The cat was healed by faith healing”, Tom said histrionically.\n“The bicycle was thrown out with the trash,” Tom hollered.\n“The cat was healed by faith healing”, Tom said histrionically.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n“I’m a humble former mayor,” Tom said humbly.\n\n\nIn this example, there is a single sentence repeated six times over, but the words are not synonyms of each other.

It was a 100-watt bulb with a green plastic cap. When I was about 11 years old, I was out in the garage with my father putting things away and I found this light bulb under a piece of plywood. I was so excited that I just had to turn it on and see what it looked like. My father knew right away what it was. I took it over to the house, rushed into my mother’s room, unscrewed the old 60-watt bulb, and screwed in the new light bulb. I quickly flicked the switch and the new light bulb lit up! My mother came into the room and said, “What are you doing? I’m sure it’s not time to change light bulbs!” I said, “I’m just testing it out to see what it does.” “Well, turn it off,” she said. “Oh, all right,” I said. I rushed over to the switch. I flipped the switch, but the new bulb didn’t go off. I held down the switch, but it still didn’t go out. I looked at my mother and said, “I don’t know what’s wrong with it!” My mother’s voice got louder and louder. She said, “You didn’t pay for this light bulb! You stole it!” I said, “No, I didn’t steal it. I just found it under a piece of plywood in the garage.” My mother said, “Well, if you didn’t pay for it, you must have stolen it.” She was sure I had stolen it, but I really did find it. I just didn’t have the guts to say that I actually did find it. That was my first light bulb. And I remember my first television set. It was also a gift.
