GPT-3 is the latest in a series of Go Bots being released by OpenAI as part of their
efforts to democratize AI and make it more accessible to the masses. GPT-3 is very different from
other bots we have built before. You can read the paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03802.pdf.
In this tutorial we'll be using Python Flask, Numpy, Pandas, and OpenAI's Deep Learning toolkit
to create a simple text-based chatbot that can interact with users via the Twilio API. The
bot will have limited functionality but I hope to show you the versatility and power of using
open source AI tools to build your next chatbot and make it actually useful and fun for
the people that interact with it.
