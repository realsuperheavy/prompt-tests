{"output":"A typical chicken egg shell is composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral which is generally bioinert, but has made a successful transition into an active product. As active product, the mineral is resistant to both thermal and mechanical forces. This can be overcome through the application of a mechanochemical reaction, which will often be reliant on thermal or mechanical energy. The mechanical energy can be applied through the use of a typical hand, while the thermal energy can be applied through the use of mechanochemical forces such","title":"complicated explanation of how to X","version":"2"}
{"output":"The act of cracking an egg is a complex process consisting of multiple steps. First, one must locate a hard-shelled egg with an intact shell from the hard-shelled egg production facility. Next, one must deploy a hard-shelled egg cracking device, separating the interior egg white from the exterior egg shell by means of a sharp impact, frictional force, and centrifugal force. The typical hard-shelled egg cracking device is a hard-shelled egg cracking device.","title":"complicated explanation of how to X","version":"2"}
{"output":"In cooking, egg cracking is the process of removing the shell from an egg in preparation for cooking. Use an egg cracker to break the eggshell into two pieces. Hold the egg over a bowl and put an egg in the bowl after breaking the eggshell. Do not discard the eggshell.","title":"complicated explanation of how to X","version":"2"}
{"output":"An egg is composed of various chemical compounds. The typical egg consists of a structure that develops into an embryo. The typical embryo is classified as a larva when outside of the uterus of an animal. A typical larva proceeds through a series of stages, and those stages are known as phytophageous stages. Phytophageous is derived from the greek term meaning feeder on plants, and the greek term is both singular and plural. During the phytophageous","title":"complicated explanation of how to X","version":"2"}
