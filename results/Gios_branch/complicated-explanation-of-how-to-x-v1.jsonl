Typically, this process involves applying force to the surface of the egg on all sides, and can be accomplished through the use of one or more appendages capable of applying force to the egg. Once the shell has been sufficiently punctured, the contents of the egg can be removed. Additional force may be applied to facilitate the release of the contents of the egg","title":"complicated explanation of how to X","version":"1"}
