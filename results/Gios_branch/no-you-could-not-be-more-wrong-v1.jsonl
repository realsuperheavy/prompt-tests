{"output":"I would like to talk about the practicality of\nrecycling.\n\nHow do you separate the recyclables from the\ngarbage?\n\nYou can't.\n\nIt isn't done any more than sorting your trash\nfor example could be done.\n\nYou can't separate light bulbs and batteries\nfrom the garbage and you can't separate paper\nfrom the plastic.\n\nSecondly, you need to address the fact that\nrecycling makes no sense.\n\nNow for a bit of math.\n\nRecycling paper uses on average 70% of the\nenergy it takes to produce new paper.\n\nThis means that as a standard rule of thumb,\nyou need to recycle paper seven times before\nit is a net energy gain over fresh paper.\n\nThe reason inherent energy is needed so many\ntimes is because the virgin or freshly\nharvested material is spent as a byproduct of\nthe process.\n\nThe U.S. uses 50% of the worlds paper and we\nrecycle only 30%.\n\nThis means that 20% of the total energy used\nin paper production is consumed by the U\n","title":"no, you could not be more wrong","version":"1"}
{"output":"the energy that is required to recycle is more\nthan what is used to just make new products in\nthe first place.\n\nSecondly, recycling takes away resources and\nenergy just to separate the different\nmaterials and put them back together again.\n\nThis is a process that is just not worth the\ntime.\n\nWhen you burn a piece of paper, you are\nreleasing all the chemicals that were in the\npaper into the air.\n\nThe paint that is on the paper releases the\nworst toxins possible.\n\nRecycling paper means that it is exposed to\nwater, which releases all those chemicals into\nthe air that you are breathing.\n\nThirdly, it is a proven scientific fact that\nlandfills cause less pollutants to be released\ninto the environment than recycling centers.\n\nMore people recycle because they are told they\nare helping the environment, when in reality\nthey are hurting the environment by adding to\nthe waste that is already in our landfills.\n\nThe reason that those who are not informed\nbelieve that recycling is good is because that\nis all\n","title":"no, you could not be more wrong","version":"1"}
{"output":"it is not good for the environment.\n\nFirstly, every time you recycle something, you\nare putting it through at least one extra\ncycle of harm to the environment.\n\nevery time you recycle glass, you melt it down\ninto sand, and then you need to get it to a\nglass factory to make it into glass again, and\nthen you need to ship it to a supermarket, you\nneed to ship it to a consumer, and you put it\nin the consumer's car, and then they ship it\nback to the factory, and put it through the\nrecycling plant again\n\n.\n\nGlass is heavy and expensive to ship.\n\nSecondly, it is not good for the economy.\n\nEvery time you recycle something, you save\nmoney, and as a result, the company that makes\nthe product you are recycling is losing money.\n\nThis means less jobs, which leads to lower\nincome for employees, which leads to lower\nspending power, which leads to less\nconsumption, which leads to less production,\nwhich leads to more unemployment, which\n","title":"no, you could not be more wrong","version":"1"}
{"output":"it is an awful use of resources to recycle\naluminum and steel.\n\nThe processing of steel and aluminum uses so\nmuch energy and water due to the fact that\nthey are incredibly pure.\n\nA more detailed explanation is that it is much\nmore efficient to use raw materials for\nproduction than it is to recycle.\n\nThe majority of energy efficiency through\nrecycling is a myth.\n\nThe reason people think this is true is\nbecause they are only looking at energy used\nin the process.\n\nAnd that is wrong.\n\nThey are not accounting for the amount of\nenergy used to find the raw materials in the\nfirst place.\n\nEvery time you recycle aluminum you are\nwasting as much energy as you would have if\nyou had used a new piece of aluminum.\n\nAnd as the commenter points out, recycling is\nextremely wasteful of a valuable resource\n(oil).\n\nA major flaw in this argument is that the\nrecycling proponent makes a comparison between\naluminum recycling and new metal production,\nrather than a comparison between aluminum\nrecycling and, say, aluminum ore mining.\n\nThe latter\n","title":"no, you could not be more wrong","version":"1"}
