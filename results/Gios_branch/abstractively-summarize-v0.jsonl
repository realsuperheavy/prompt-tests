{"output":"The vagus nerve is part of our parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the body’s “rest and digest”\nresponse. It originates in the brain stem, and travels down the neck to the chest, abdomen and pelvis. The vagus nerve helps us switch off our\n’fight or flight’ response, and is involved in the regulation of heart rate, digestion and other bodily functions.","title":"abstractively summarize","version":"0"}
